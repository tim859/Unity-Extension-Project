# Basic Unity Extension Project

A project made for the Games Technology module in the second year of my Computer Science (Games) course.

This project is made up of three tools:

1. An NPC path tool that allows you to map out the paths of NPC's without having to do tons of manual coding.

2. A measurement tool that allows you to measure distances in units between points in unity on each of the different axis.

3. A paint brush tool that allows you to paint prefabs (like trees or bushes or something) onto the environment.
